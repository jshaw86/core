### Error Reporting

By default, Kohana displays all errors, including strict mode warnings. This is set using [error_reporting](http://php.net/error_reporting):

    error_reporting(E_ALL | E_STRICT);

When you application is live and in production, a more conservative setting is recommended, such as ignoring notices:

    error_reporting(E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE);

If you get a white screen when an error is triggered, your host probably has disabled displaying errors. You can turn it on again by adding this line just after your `error_reporting` call:

    ini_set('display_errors', TRUE);

Errors should **always** be displayed, even in production, because it allows you to use [exception and error handling](debugging.errors) to serve a nice error page rather than a blank white screen when an error happens.
