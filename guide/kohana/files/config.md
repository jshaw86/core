<http://kohanaframework.org/guide/using.configuration>

This should discuss config files relating to kohana core that aren't discussed in their respective modules. (inflector.php for example.)

This should do better at describing making and using your own config files.

Also reinforce that config files are merged by the cascade, not overwritten.
